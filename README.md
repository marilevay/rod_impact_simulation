# One Dimensional Rebound of a Rod

**Mathematical Modelling Research Group - Minerva University**

**Objectives**: 
- Determine the peak strain on the rod when it bounces off the floor.
- Determine how the peak strain depends on the parameters describing the rod and the strength of the impact.

**Current Investigation**: sampling time extremes; how much can we reduce the time interval between each time step without having inconsistencies in the stress curve?
